However, it quickly became apparent to my colleagues that my contributions to the UI were noteworthy, and as a result, I was reassigned to the role of the sole UI/UX designer relatively early on.<br><br>As the UI/UX designer, I took on the responsibility of designing the entire interface for the <i>Revvis</i> application. This involved creating a theme and design system that would ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience for our users. My tasks primarily consisted of designing multiple interfaces and creating a catalog system. I took great care to ensure that the interfaces were both aesthetically pleasing and functional, while the catalog system was easy to navigate and visually appealing.<br><br>Overall, my time at <b>Revvis Ltd.</b> allowed me to showcase my design skills and grow as a UI/UX designer. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the success of the project.",
